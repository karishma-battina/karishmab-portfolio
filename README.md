# Devops Engineer

Hi! I’m Karishma, a DevOps Engineer originally from India and now based in the USA.

I’m passionate about technology and thrive on exploring new languages and frameworks, improving performance, and tackling real-world challenges that make a difference.

Outside of work, I enjoy photography, cooking, and engaging in DIY projects. I’m also an avid reader of software development and philosophical books, drawing inspiration from my background in humanism.

- Part of Dell GitLab Shared Runners team, providing highly available, standardized, and version-controlled build and deployment execution environments for 5,000+ Dell GitLab users.
- Spearheaded the creation and maintenance of 20+ automated BuildOps pipelines, leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices to support a 40% user growth across the Dell Digital Organization.
- Automated over 90% of manual tasks, resulting in a 30% increase in operational efficiency and a 25% reduction in errors, by deploying, upgrading, and managing GitLab runners using Terraform, Ansible, Bash, PowerShell, and Helm Charts across multi-cloud platforms.
- Developed and optimized DevOps pipelines that accelerated deployment times by 60%, reduced operational costs by 50%, and managed scalable, highly available Kubernetes environments with zero downtime, supporting critical business operations.

**Cloud Applications Engineer @ Oracle, Hyderabad India (_Oct 2020 - Sep 2021_)**
- Deployed multiple microservices from legacy environments to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) using Ansible playbooks for deployment automation, emphasizing increased automation and efficiency.
- Managed Docker containers, implemented Docker files, built new images, and managed source code using Gitlab, actively participating in code reviews and resolving merge conflicts.
- Supported and troubleshot deployment issues in production data centers, configured PCP and Nagios for effective monitoring, and used JIRA for sprint planning and tracking defects and issues.

**IT Analyst @ Tata Consultancy Services, Hyderabad, India (_Oct 2020 - Sep 2021_)**
- Onboarded 10+ services from a legacy environment to the cloud using Python. Configured Compute Cluster (HPC platform), vCloud, Linux compute, and physical server-based services. Developed Puppet roles for automated configuration and implemented Ansible playbooks with AWX for remote operations.
- Managed and executed project phases on-site in Sweden over a year, coordinating with customers and utilizing JIRA for tracking 150+ tickets. Automated ticket processing using REST APIs, reducing manual handling time by 40%.
- Applied Agile methodologies, created Jenkins build and deployment jobs for DEV, QA, and UAT environments, and gained proficiency in Python modules, debugging, and testing frameworks.

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
